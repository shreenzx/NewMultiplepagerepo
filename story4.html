            <p>Lilium longiflorum flower – 1. stigma, 2. style, 3. anthers, 4. filament, 5. tepal
                Lilies are tall perennials ranging in height from 1–6 ft (30–180 cm). They form naked or tunicless scaly underground bulbs which are their organs of perennation. In some North American species the base of the bulb develops into rhizomes, on which numerous small bulbs are found. Some species develop stolons.[4] Most bulbs are buried deep in the ground, but a few species form bulbs near the soil surface. Many species form stem-roots. With these, the bulb grows naturally at some depth in the soil, and each year the new stem puts out adventitious roots above the bulb as it emerges from the soil. These roots are in addition to the basal roots that develop at the base of the bulb, a number of species also produce contractile roots that move the bulbs deeper into the soil.
                The botanic name Lilium is the Latin form and is a Linnaean name. The Latin name is derived from the Greek word λείριον leírion, generally assumed to refer to true, white lilies as exemplified by the Madonna lily.[23][24][25] The word was borrowed from Coptic (dial. Fayyumic) hleri, from standard hreri, from Demotic hrry, from Egyptian hrṛt "flower".[26] Meillet maintains that both the Egyptian and the Greek word are possible loans from an extinct, substratum language of the Eastern Mediterranean.[citation needed] Ancient Greek: κρῖνον, krīnon, was used by the Greeks, albeit for lilies of any color.[27]
                
                Lilies can be propagated in several ways:

            <br>
            <p>by division of the bulbs
                by growing-on bulbils which are adventitious bulbs formed on the stem
                by scaling, for which whole scales are detached from the bulb and planted to form a new bulb
                by seed; there are many seed germination patterns, which can be complex
                by micropropagation techniques (which include tissue culture);[57] commercial quantities of lilies are often propagated in vitro and then planted out to grow into plants large enough to sell. A highly efficient technique for multiple shoot and propagule formation was given by Yadav et al., in 2013.
                Plant grow regulators (PGRs) are used to limit the height of lilies, especial those sold as potted plants; commonly used chemicals include ancymidol, fluprimidol, paclobutrazol, and uni-conazole, which are applied to the foliage and retard the biosynthesis of gibberellins, a class of plant hormones responsible for stem growth
