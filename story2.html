            <p>The oldest remains of roses are from the Late Eocene Florissant Formation of Colorado.Roses were present in Europe by the early Oligocene.

                Today's garden roses come from 18th-century China.[9] Among the old Chinese garden roses, the Old Blush group is the most primitive, while newer groups are the most diverse.
                The genus Rosa is composed of 140â€“180 species and divided into four subgenera
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Hulthemia (formerly Simplicifoliae, meaning "with single leaves") containing two species from southwest Asia, Rosa persica and Rosa berberifolia, which are the only roses without compound leaves or stipules.
                Hesperrhodos (from the Greek for "western rose") contains Rosa minutifolia and Rosa stellata, from North America.
                Platyrhodon (from the Greek for "flaky rose", referring to flaky bark) with one species from east Asia, Rosa roxburghii (also known as the chestnut rose).
                Rosa (the type subgenus, sometimes incorrectly called Eurosa) containing all the other roses. This subgenus is subdivided into 11 sections.
